Tips for good eval

- End to end eval is expensive
- Build eval for component (tool)

Benefits of component-level evaluations

• Can provide clearer signal for specific errors
  • Avoid the noise in end-to-end system

• More efficient for focused team to optimize
  • Work on smaller, more targeted problems faster
